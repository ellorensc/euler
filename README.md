# Euler Project README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running. 

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just
mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
    
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind
to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
    
Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an
interest in the fascinating world of mathematics.
